#1. Create a new GitHub Action workflow file in your repository, such as .github/workflows/push-to-scratch-org.yml
#2. Define the trigger for the workflow, such as push or pull_request , depending on your needs.
#3. Set up the Salesforce CLI by installing it in the GitHub Actions runner environment and authenticating with your Dev Hub org. You can use the
#setup-salesforce-cli action for this.
#4. Create a new scratch org using the force:org:create command. You can specify the edition, username, and other options as needed.
#5. Push the latest release from the main branch to the scratch org using the force:source:push command.
#6. Run any tests or other tasks you need to validate the deployment.
#7. Optionally, delete the scratch org using the force:org:delete command.
